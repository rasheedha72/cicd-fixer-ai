    "ai_fix": " The error message indicates that there is a problem with installing the package `fastapi==0.105`, as it cannot find a compatible version in the Python Package Index (PyPI). However, it seems that only versions 0.70, 0.71, and 0.72 are available for `fastapi`.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to fix this issue:\n\n1. Check the required version of fastapi in your project's dependencies file (e.g., requirements.txt or pipfile). Ensure that it is either compatible with the versions available on PyPI, or update it to a newer version if possible. In this case, updating to 0.72 might be a good idea since it's the latest version available.\n\n2. If you're using `pip` for dependency management, run the following command in your terminal to upgrade fastapi to the latest compatible version:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade fastapi\n   ```\n\n   After successfully upgrading fastapi, you may need to update other dependencies that depend on it. This can usually be done by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` or the equivalent command for your package manager.\n\n3. If updating fastapi isn't an option (e.g., due to compatibility issues with your project), you may have to create a virtual environment with a specific Python version that has the required version of fastapi available, or download the wheel file manually from PyPI and install it using `pip install /path/to/fastapi-0.105-py3-none-any.whl`.\n\n4. After updating/installing the necessary dependencies, run the CI/CD pipeline again to see if the error persists.\n\n",

    "ai_fix": " Based on the provided log, it seems that the CI/CD pipeline is trying to install the FastAPI package version 0.105 but could not find any matching distribution. This suggests that the specified version is either outdated or does not exist anymore.\n\nHere's a step-by-step fix for this issue:\n\n1. Check if FastAPI version 0.105 still exists on PyPI (Python Package Index) by visiting this URL: https://pypi.org/project/FastAPI/#files\n   If it does, update the version in your requirements file or pipeline configuration accordingly and try running the pipeline again.\n\n2. If FastAPI version 0.105 is not available anymore (which seems likely), you should update the version in your requirements file or pipeline configuration to the latest stable release (currently 0.85.0 as of March 2023) and try running the pipeline again.\n\nIn addition, it might be helpful to double-check that your codebase is compatible with the new FastAPI version by making any necessary adjustments or updates if required. Also, ensure you have the latest pip installed on your environment:\n\n```sh\npip install --upgrade pip\n```\n\nThis should help resolve the dependency error and enable a successful build in your CI/CD pipeline.\n\n",
